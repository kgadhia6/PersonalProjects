EulerDiffEqMethod.py: Plots the solutions of a first order system of ordinary differential equations using the Euler forward step method.
Utilizes numpy and matplotlib.


GradientFields.py: Plots the gradient and Laplacian of a multivariate function that takes in 2 inputs (x, y) and outputs 1 value (z).
Utilizes numpy and matplotlib.


PDEDiscretizer.py: Plots the integration of a partial differential equation in respect to x. If you want to do so in respect to y, just swap the params.
Utilizes numpy and matplotlib.


VectorFields.py: Plots the vector field, divergence, and curl of a vector-valued function.
Utilizes numpy, sympy, and matplotlib.

PhasePortraits3D.py: Plots the 3D vector field of the phase portrait of a 3D system of ordinary differential equations.
Utilizes numpy, and matplotlib.
