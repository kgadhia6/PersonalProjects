# Personal Projects
A majority of my personal projects that I'm proud of / working on, largely those relating to applied mathematics though.

The folder names should be rather self-explanatory, and in each folder there will be a file called DESCRIPTIONS.md that will contain descriptions of each project file in the folder.
